# Meter Miser
 
 
## Overview:
Small business owners that operate retail storefronts have a lot to do every day.  Remembering to turn down/up the thermostat often falls to the very bottom of a very long "To Do" list.  Yet, forgetting this task can cost this small business owner hundreds or even thousands of dollars per year depending on the number an size of their retail locations.
What if there were a way to intelligently monitor and alert the small business owner when there are opportunities to adjust the thermostat and generate cost savings?
 
 
**Concept:**
* Automated and periodic polling of wi-fi enabled thermostats in each location
* Persistent storage of collected data for analysis and actionable insights
* Mobile first design to leverage the small business owners most powerful tool -- the smart phone
* Dynamic and interactive charts to quickly identify trends and compare locations
* Ability to take action (adjust/turn off) on the thermostat

## Challenges & Solutions:
**Some of the biggest challenges we faced with this project build included:**
 
<br />1.  **Challenge:** Back-end implementation for polling, persistent storage and client APIs
 
    **Solution:**  We had some team member experiences with relational databases and SQL but not with any particular backend technologies.  After consultation with the DigitalCrafts instructor, we chose Express as the "front-end" to our back-end services.  This choice enabled us to leverage javascript and have a working solution up quickly.  The fact that the API responds with JSON makes it very easy to consume these services from our front-end client.<br />
 
 
<br />2.  **Challenge:**   Front-End:
    We ran into a few issues regarding elements of bootstrap not working correctly. Toggles would not toggle, drop down menus did not function properly, and CDNs were not responding as anticipated.
 
    **Solution:**<br />
 
    These issues were resolved by spending hours upon hours searching the internet and developer communities such as Stackoverflow.com, and talking with our instructor Rob.  we found solutions to all of
    the front-end issues by using these methods and was successfully able to implement them into our application.
 
<br />3.  **Challenge:**  Learning D3.js
  D3.js has a steep learning curve and many resources were with older versions of the module.
 
    **Solution:**<br />
These issues were resolved going through different reference manuals, working with demo graphs, and with Rob.  We were able to compare v3 and v4 to resolve most issues.  We were able to implement an interactive component by adding a callback function to our event-listeners. <br />
 
 
##Code Snippets
 
<!-- Insert code here -->
We created a front-end service to access the API we built on the back-end. 
 
```JavaScript
//App Service for accessing the API
var getLocationsURL = 'http://ec2-18-221-219-61.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/Locations';
$.get(getLocationsURL, function( locations, status ) {....
```
