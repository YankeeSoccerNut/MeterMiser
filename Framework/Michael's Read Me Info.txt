Technologies used:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Git, GitHub

Framework: Bootstrap

Overview:

Built custom HTML layout using Bootstrap framework and created custom styling for all aspects of application.
Scheduled daily meetings and worked alongside with Scrum team on application from concept to completion. Developed
visual and UI aspects of MeterMiser.

Problem & Solutions:

I ran into a few issues regarding elements of bootstrap not working correctly. Toggles would not toggle, drop down menus did not function properly, and CDNs were not responding as anticipated.
These issues were resolved by spending hours upon hours searching the internet and developer communities such as Stackoverflow.com, and talking with our instructor Rob.  I found solutions to all of
the front-end issues by using these methods and was successfully able to implement them into our application.
